    - JENKINS CONTAINER
    - ANSIBLE AWX CONTAINER
2. CROSS PLATFORM - CentOS / Ubuntu
3. FIX METHOD FOR GETTING ID_RSA GENERATED BY ANSIBLE
4. continue work with docker_compose
5. Refactor code to include all hosts to be launched in parallel and fix problem with add Host - now it is not working properly because only one host is added in a batch execution.
